          <p class="callout"><b>The Baxter Center for Science Education (BCSE) is a collaborative partnership between Lindblom Math &amp; Science Academy (LMSA), Round Lake Area Schools, the Office of Community Education Partnerships (OCEP) at Northwestern University, and Baxter International Foundation.</b> The Baxter Center catalyzes partnerships and builds impactful student experiences and educator professional development programs, focused on the specific needs of communities in Chicago and the greater region, to promote student success and equity in STEM education and career pathways. Specifically, the Baxter Center seeks to increase: 1) access, opportunity, engagement, and empowerment of youth in STEM—primarily youth from communities traditionally underrepresented in STEM, and 2) representation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in STEM fields and leadership roles.

          <h2 class="left">What we do</h2>
          <p class="callout">Baxter Center programs have always been centered around providing authentic science content and learning experiences for students and teachers. Over the past few years, we have expanded the structure and content of our programs to reflect the evolving values and goals of our partners and our communities. We now focus on five primary areas of work:</p>
          <ol class="callout">
            <li>Authentic Science Content: We’re known for offering hands-on, cutting-edge life science activities for teachers to try with their students. </li>
            <li>Practice & Community: We design our programs to enable participants to enact what they learn, and to learn with and from each other.</li>
            <li>Equity and Social Justice: We focus on access, opportunity, engagement, and empowerment of students and teachers, particularly those from communities historically underrepresented in STEM.</li>
            <li>Teacher Leadership: We position and support teachers as professionals, cultivating and supporting teachers as leaders and co-designers of Baxter Center programs.</li>
            <li>Community Connections: We know there are more teacher leaders in our network than we can support directly, though we wish we had more capacity. Luckily there are many organizations in the Chicago-area that also do amazing work! We strive to become a Hub that connects resources that exist with those who want them.</li>

          <img class="curve right" src="{% staticfile 'img/about_3.png' %}">
          <p class="callout"><b>Elevating Educators</b><br>The Baxter Center is best known for its innovative professional learning opportunities for Chicago-area educators. From our foundational programming like the <a href="/standalonePage/baxter_symposium" target="_blank">Baxter Symposium</a> and the our <a href="/workshops/list" target="_blank">Workshop Series</a> and <a href="/baxter_box/info/" target="_blank">Baxter Box Loaner Program</a> to our expanding work with <a href="/about/teacherLeaders" target="_blank">teacher leaders</a> and providing <a href="/standalonePage/ret" target="_blank">research experiences</a>, we provide a variety of programs to engage new teachers with hands-on science and inspire our long-time participants with the excitement about cutting-edge science that gets carried back to the classroom to educate the next generation of innovators.</p>

         <p class="callout"><b>Engaging Students</b><br>
         The Baxter Center strives to provide students, particularly those from under-resourced schools and communities, with opportunities to engage in a range of experiences that help them see themselves as future STEM and manufacturing professionals. We design each experience with an eye towards empowering the youth we serve with strong STEM identities.
         </p>

         <p class="callout"><b>Supporting Schools and Districts </b><br>
         The Baxter Center has always been nimble, working to continuously assess and adapt to district, school, and teacher needs through collaborating at multiple levels. We are excited to serve as a connector within the Chicagoland K-12 STEM learning ecosystem by matching existing community resources and expertise with those who need them, building greater capacity for all. </p>

          <h3>Teacher comments </h3>
          <div class="testimonial"> I loved how the Next Generation Science Standards were incorporated. Especially love how these were included: experimental design, crosscutting concepts, data gathering and analysis. And also where students experienced frustration and success, how to scaffold for grade bands, and levels of difficulty and sophistication.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">I increased both my knowledge and skill base. Getting a jump-start by having supplies to take back to the classroom helps to avoid budget as a reason not to do a lab is awesome! Also, now I have such a great group of people to work with and count on for support during the school year.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">This was truly a privilege and an honor to take part in this experience. This experience was on one hand guided - in terms of the curriculum project and debriefing of the science - and on the other hand learnercentered - such as pursuing our own research questions. This allowed for both challenge and growth - all wonderful. The facilitators were truly kind, dedicated, bright people. This experience was wonderful! Thank you!</div>

          <p class="callout">Since 2009 we have hosted over <b>229</b> workshops and trained <b>3,659</b> teachers from <b>402</b> schools in CPS and the greater Chicagoland area, reaching over <b>240,000</b> students. </p>

          <h2>What sets us apart</h2>
          <p class="callout">We provide comprehensive services to support science education in the classroom. We have learned that to affect real change, you can’t just do teacher PD, you can’t just give away equipment, and you can’t just visit the classroom. To be successful, you have to do all three as a living, responsive, flexible program built on strong relationships with teachers and schools, adjusting to their evolving needs.</p>

          <h3>Teacher comments </h3>
          <div class="testimonial"> The Baxter Box program has made these lab activities economically feasible. I would never have been able to do these labs without the Baxter Center.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">I taught for many years before discovering the Baxter Center and all it has to offer. As much as I cherish my days off in the summer, I have never regretted spending 2 or 3 summer days at one of their workshops. The activities are always very hands-on, with a chance to learn from helpful people who have worked or are working in research labs. In addition to the presenters, you will get all sorts of ideas and resources from networking with the other participants as well. The free lab materials make it so easy to take what you learn back to your students and let them experience first-hand the joys of learning by doing. The support is amazing. I would recommend any of the Baxter Center Symposiums and workshops to both new and experienced teachers who are interested in feeling like a scientist for a day or more, and then sharing that sensation with their students.</div>
