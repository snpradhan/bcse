          <p class="callout"><b>The Baxter Center for Science Education (BCSE) is a collaborative partnership between the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University, Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Round Lake Area Schools, and the Baxter Foundation, with evolving and responsive expansions to our broader communities of Cook and Lake Counties.</b> The BCSE provides impactful educator professional development (PD) programs, supports meaningful classroom and student STEM experiences, and catalyzes mutually beneficial collaborations within the STEM education ecosystem of Chicagoland. Through these initiatives, the BCSE seeks to promote engagement and confidence in STEM among Chicagoland youth and teachers, and leadership opportunities among Chicagoland teachers.

          <h2 class="left">What We Do</h2>
          <p class="callout">BCSE programs have always been rooted in providing authentic science learning experiences for teachers and students. Over the past few years, we have expanded the structure and content of our programs to reflect the evolving values and goals of our partners and our communities. Our work is guided by four overlapping pillars: </p>
          <ol class="callout">
            <li><b>Authentic Science Content</b>: We’re known for offering hands-on, cutting-edge life science activities in our programmatic offerings.  </li>
            <li><b>Practice & Community</b>: We design our programs to enable participants to enact what they learn, and to learn with and from each other. </li>
            <li><b>Teacher Leadership</b>: We position and support teachers as professionals, cultivating and supporting teachers as leaders and co-designers of BCSE programs. </li>
            <li><b>Community Connections</b>: We seek to build greater capacity for all through serving as a connector, matching existing community resources and expertise with needs.  </li>
          </ol>

               <b>Elevating Educators</b><br>
               The BCSE is best known for its innovative professional development opportunities for Chicagoland science educators. With programs like the <a href="/standalonePage/baxter_symposium" target="_blank">Baxter Center Symposium</a>, <a href="/workshops/list/current" target="_blank">Workshops</a>, and <a href="/standalonePage/ret" target="_blank">Research Experience for Teachers</a>, we aim to engage new teachers and inspire long-time participants with cutting-edge science that can shape the next generation of innovators.
            </li>

            <li>
               <b>Supporting Classrooms</b><br>
               The BCSE seeks to ensure that educators have the supplies they need to do meaningful STEM work with students across Chicagoland and aims to support a circular economy of lab supplies and equipment. The <a href="/baxter_box/info/" target="_blank">Box Program</a> and <a href="/standalonePage/lab_grant" target="_blank">Lab Grants Program</a> are two major initiatives here.
            </li>

            <li>
               <b>Engaging Students, Partner Schools, and Local Communities </b><br>
               The BCSE supports students at our partner schools (Lindblom and Round Lake) in meaningful STEM experiences connected to local STEM opportunities and career pathways. We also work to continuously assess and adapt to community opportunities and needs through collaborating with schools, districts, and other organizations at multiple levels.

          <h3>Teacher comments </h3>
          <div class="testimonial"> I loved how the Next Generation Science Standards were incorporated. Especially love how these were included: experimental design, crosscutting concepts, data gathering and analysis. And also where students experienced frustration and success, how to scaffold for grade bands, and levels of difficulty and sophistication.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">I increased both my knowledge and skill base. Getting a jump-start by having supplies to take back to the classroom helps to avoid budget as a reason not to do a lab is awesome! Also, now I have such a great group of people to work with and count on for support during the school year.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">This was truly a privilege and an honor to take part in this experience. This experience was on one hand guided - in terms of the curriculum project and debriefing of the science - and on the other hand learnercentered - such as pursuing our own research questions. This allowed for both challenge and growth - all wonderful. The facilitators were truly kind, dedicated, bright people. This experience was wonderful! Thank you!</div>

          <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
          <p class="callout">We provide comprehensive services to support science education in the classroom. We have learned that to affect real change, you can’t just do PD, you can’t just give away equipment, and you can’t just visit the classroom. To be successful, you have to do all three as a living, responsive, flexible set of programs built on strong relationships with teachers and schools, adjusting to their evolving needs.</p>

          <h3>Teacher comments </h3>
          <div class="testimonial"> The Baxter Box program has made these lab activities economically feasible. I would never have been able to do these labs without the Baxter Center.</div>
          <div class="testimonial">I taught for many years before discovering the Baxter Center and all it has to offer. As much as I cherish my days off in the summer, I have never regretted spending 2 or 3 summer days at one of their workshops. The activities are always very hands-on, with a chance to learn from helpful people who have worked or are working in research labs. In addition to the presenters, you will get all sorts of ideas and resources from networking with the other participants as well. The free lab materials make it so easy to take what you learn back to your students and let them experience first-hand the joys of learning by doing. The support is amazing. I would recommend any of the Baxter Center Symposiums and workshops to both new and experienced teachers who are interested in feeling like a scientist for a day or more, and then sharing that sensation with their students.</div>
